## Projects

### [TP1 - ThreeJS Basics](tp1)

- The lighting in the scene is pleasant, highlighting all the important features all the while providing nice shadow projections. The materials chosen for each surface seem just right, specially when considering which are specular and which are not. The scene is creative, and there are additions beyond the required to add touches of realism and more life to the scene, such as napkins, chairs, a door. It is also worth noting that the outside view from the window simulates a 3D view instead of utilizing a simple plane for the view, which grants it a touch of more realism.
- Scene
  - The scene is supposed to mirror an abandoned birthday party, with allusions to wartorn countries and unexpected departures from family homes.

### [TP2 - Development of a 3D graphics application](tp2)
- The work features a fully fledged YASF structured JSON file parser with error identification, optimized routines for repeated references and creation of objects, and a fully functioning and accurate "as strictly needed" setting propagation system to avoid useless propagations.
- The parser also generates completely automatically a GUI.
- All required features as YASF primitives and functionalities are available and supported by the parser.
- No example scene for this project has been developed due to insufficient diligence.
