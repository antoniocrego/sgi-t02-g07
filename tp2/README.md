### [TP2 - Development of a 3D graphics application](tp2)
- The work features a fully fledged YASF structured JSON file parser with error identification, optimized routines for repeated references and creation of objects, and a fully functioning and accurate "as strictly needed" setting propagation system to avoid useless propagations of inherited settings.
- The parser also generates completely automatically a GUI to control many of the user-specified aspects of the loaded file.
- All required features such as YASF primitives and functionalities are available and supported by the parser.
- Scene
  - No example scene for this project has been developed due to insufficient diligence.
  - There is, however, an [example file](https://gitlab.up.pt/meic-sgi/sgi-2024-2025/t02/sgi-t02-g07/-/blob/9522c61b2868bb5f5561d7e871d51efbdcd1204b/tp2/scenes/demo/demo.json) that uses and demonstrates most developed features and was used during development for testing purposes.
